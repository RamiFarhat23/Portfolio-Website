# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website that I made to showcase my own projects, it is constantly being updated. It was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS styling.

## Run Instructions
It can be accessed [here](https://ramifarhat23.github.io/Portfolio-Website/). If you would like to access it from the source code, download the files and drag the HTML file into your web browswer.
